Looking at all reviews, we can see that most places have had less than 1000 reviews. There are some outliers that get more than 3000 reviews but this is very uncommon. When looking for places that have high reviews the team should aim for locations having over 1000 reviews, but be aware they may need to work with 500 reviews or more. \n",

        "When looking at just the reviews we excluded a single outlying value so that we could see the majority of the data. To show the impact, we can look at the range of number of reviews by place with this outlier in the data. In the graphic below you can see that this outlier is dominating the data and making comparison difficult. To make it easier to compare the rest of the data, we will remove this outlier.\n",

        "After we remove the outlier we can focus on the main range of data. Although Coffee Shops do include the place types with the largest number of reviews, the interquartile range of the number of reviews is lower than Cafe and espresso bar types. This would suggest that the majority of the number of reviews may be lower than other types. However, this could also be an effect of having the largest number of locations, so the large number of low review locations brings the median down.  \n",

        "Based on all of the above, we would recommend that the team focus on coffee shops with reviews over 1000 to start, but also keeps an open mind to including cafes and espresso bars with high reviews. Further analysis should be done to understand if store type really does impact the number of reviews. The team should also consider including their cups in stores with lower reviews so that we can further analyze whether reviews has any impact over the popularity of the new cups.  \n"
