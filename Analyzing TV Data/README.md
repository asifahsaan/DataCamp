This project gives you an opportunity to apply the skills from Intermediate Python for Data Science. DataCamp projects are completed in Jupyter Notebooks. If you'd like more info on Jupyter Notebooks, check out this introduction.

DataCamp projects are more open-ended than DataCamp courses. The "Check Project" button checks to see if you have completed tasks in the project, though it doesn't check for absolute code "correctness" as there can be multiple "correct" solutions sometimes. The Jupyter Notebook will still provide error messages if your code causes an error. Consult the hint and the expected output image to see what one correct solution looks like.

The hints for this project consist of the solution code with minimal fill-in-the-blanks represented by underscores.

If you experience odd behavior you can reset the project by clicking the circular arrow in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Resetting the project will discard all code you have written so be sure to save it offline first.
